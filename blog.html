        What is event loop? and how does it work?

      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          What is event loop? <br><br>
          In computer programming, an event loop is a programming <br>
          construct or design pattern that waits for and <br>
          dispatches events or messages in a program <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          how does event loop work? <br> <br>
          The event loop in JavaScript is a fundamental concept <br>
          that determines how asynchronous code is executed. Here <br>
          is an overview of how it works: <br> <br>

          The JavaScript runtime maintains a call stack, which keeps track of function calls in the program. <br>

          When a function is called, it is added to the call stack. When the function returns, it is removed from the
          call stack. <br>

          Asynchronous tasks, such as I/O operations or timer events, are executed separately from the call stack in the
          background. <br>

        Difference between localstorage and sessionstorage and cookies?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>
          Local Storage <br> <br>

          Local storage is a place to store some data in the browser's store. <br>
          Lifetime can keep 10MB of data for each Web-Site or Web App <br>
          for this

          Sensitive data should not be kept in local storage. <br>

          We refer to Local Storage as 'localStorage'. <br>
          I can access this object.<br>

          And some objects of Local Storage: <br><br>

          localStorage.setItem('myCat', 'Tom');<br>
          localStorage.getItem('myCat');<br>
          localStorage.removeItem('myCat');<br>
          localStorage.clear();<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Session Storage <br> <br>

          Session Storage and Local Storage <br>
          It is similar in all aspects except one. <br>

          Session Storage is kept separate for this one reason.<br>
          And that is when some data for an App<br>
          When stored in Session Storage<br>
          That data will remain as long as the browser or tab is open.<br>
          If you close Browser or Tab Open, the data will no longer be there.<br>

          Some Objects of Session Storage:<br><br>

          sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");<br>
          sessionStorage.getItem("key");<br>
          sessionStorage.removeItem("key");<br>
          sessionStorage.clear();<br> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies <br> <br>
          Cookies are small data files that are stored on a computer or mobile device<br>
          when you visit a website. These files contain<br>
          information such as login credentials, preferences, <br>
          and browsing activity. Cookies are created by websites and <br>
          sent to a user's web browser, which stores the information for future use.<br>

        <p>
          Map in javascript <br> <br>
          In JavaScript, map is a higher-order function that creates <br>
          a new array containing the results of calling a <br>
          provided function on every element in the original array. <br> <br>

        </p>
        <p>
          Filter in javascript <br> <br>
          In JavaScript, the filter() method is used to create a new array <br>
          containing all elements of an existing array that pass <br>
          a specific test provided by a function <br><br>

        </p>
        <p>
          Find in javascript <br> <br>
          The find() method in JavaScript is an array method that <br>
          searches an array for the first element that satisfies <br>
          a given condition and returns that element.r> <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Foreach in javascript <br> <br>
          forEach is a method in JavaScript that is used to loop <br>
          through an array and execute a function on each element of the array.
